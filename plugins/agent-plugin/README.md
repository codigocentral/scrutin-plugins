# Scrutin AI assistant plugin

Read existing Scrutin analysis results in your authorized organization. The tools
list repositories and analyses, retrieve findings and dependency vulnerabilities,
and evaluate quality gates. They do not run scans, modify code, apply patches,
or post PR comments. Fixes proposed by the assistant are suggestions to review.

## Requirements

- A Scrutin account with an organization and completed cloud analyses.
- Free includes aggregate summaries. Individual analysis details require Pro or
  higher; PR/repository quality gates require Enterprise.
- Access to `https://mcp.scrutin.dev/mcp` over Streamable HTTP.

## Connect and authorize

In Codex CLI, connect directly:

```bash
codex mcp add scrutin --url https://mcp.scrutin.dev/mcp
codex mcp login scrutin
```

For Cursor, put this in `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "scrutin": { "url": "https://mcp.scrutin.dev/mcp" } } }
```

For ChatGPT, add the URL in developer mode to test the remote MCP connection.
This root `plugin.json` / `mcp.json` package follows Agent Plugins 1.0 and can
be submitted to OpenAI or imported into Cursor from disk. OpenAI's interface
extension is ignored by other Agent Plugins clients. Submit the `agent-plugin`
folder in the exported public repository to Cursor's publishing portal.

To create an OpenAI or Cursor submission ZIP from this public repository:

```bash
(cd plugins/agent-plugin && zip -r ../../scrutin-agent-plugin.zip .)
```

## Try it

- "List my repositories in Scrutin."
- "Show critical findings from the latest analysis of my repository."
- "Explain the quality gate evaluation for that analysis."
- "Summarize the latest analysis counts and aggregate metrics."

The three skills are `review-pr`, `explain-finding`, and `repository-risk`.
They interpret existing results. They report missing data and plan restrictions
without inventing findings or claiming that work was performed.

## Privacy Policy

Tools expose analysis results from the organization you authorize. Findings may
include file names, line references, code excerpts, and vulnerability information.
Retrieved data is shared with your connected assistant and handled under its
provider's policies and the [Scrutin Privacy Policy](https://scrutin.dev/privacy).
Tokens authorize read-only access; no public package contains credentials.
Revoke the connection in Scrutin Settings → Integrations → Connected apps.
